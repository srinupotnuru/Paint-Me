# Paint-Me
- This is a simple clone for MS-Paint which allows us to draw rectangles with mouse events and will automatically assigns random colors on drawing the rectangle.
- The drawn rectangles are completely dragable.
- Double clicking any rectangle can delete a rectangle item.
- May looks simple but hell of a debugging😢 while building.
